When upgrading an OpenHIM instance to version 6.0.x, a couple of upgrade functions are triggered in the background.

## Transactions Upgrade

From version 5.x.x transaction request bodies, response bodies, orchestrations and route request/response bodies are being stored in GridFS collections. When running an OpenHIM version 6.0.x instance for the first time, it attempts to migrate all existing transaction data to GridFS.
